#  Backup list for backup v0.7
#
#  This file contains a list of directories which will be backed up by
#  backup each time it is run. If you specify a path to a script it will 
#  be run and it's output (if it's placed in the correct directory) will
#  be backed up.
#
#  Some examples:
#  /usr/local/bin/
#  /usr/local/sbin/
#  /etc/
#  /usr/local/bin/mysql_dump.sh

# Normal directories
D:/etc
D:/var/mail
D:/usr/local/bin
D:/usr/local/sbin

# Include script output to backup particular home directories
I:/usr/local/bin/backup/homedirs.sh

# Custom script will put backups of mysql databases into the backup dir.
C:/usr/local/bin/backup/mysql.sh
